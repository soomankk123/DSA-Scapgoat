# DSA-Scapgoat

This code is a concept of scapegoat algorithm
a scapegoat tree is a self-balancing binary search tree, invented by Arne Andersson and again by Igal Galperin and Ronald L. Rivest. 
It provides worst-case O(log n) lookup time, and O(log n) amortized insertion and deletion time.
insertion is implemented with the same basic ideas as an unbalanced binary search tree
scapegoat trees need to store an additional value with the tree data structure.
it has funtions:
insert
find_scapegoat
size of sub tree
re balance
build tree from sorted tree
delete
print tree.
